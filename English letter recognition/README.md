# Hi my name is Allen, welcome to my ML project!
This project is all written by myself,with some help by my father.
## Basic about this project
This project is about CNN, which is convolution neural network.
To understand it, you need to know how machine learning works, I didn't use any machine learning module(Tensorflow,keras,etc...)
But I read a lot of books about deep learning,so I'll be able to start it at the bottom.
I'll not explain the algorithms & details about how layers work here.
